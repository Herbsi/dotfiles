* ~$DOTFILES~

A tidy ~$HOME~ is a tidy mind.

These are my dotfiles, managed using [[https://chezmoi.io][chezmoi]].

Install by running
#+begin_src  sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply Herbsi
#+end_src

** Windows installation notes

First things first, enable Developer Mode under System > Advanced in Settings.
Among other things, this allows ~winget~ to create links and so ~PATH~ does not become too long.

If ~%USERPROFILE%~ contains problematic characters, then winget might not update ~PATH~ correctly.
To check, press ~Win + R~, enter ~SystemPropertiesAdvanced~, click ~Environment Variables...~ and check the values in ~PATH~.

You may need to run ~powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c chezmoi apply~ the first time, so that the install scripts are executed.

- [ ] Install terminal theme.
- [ ] Install fonts.
